        <p>If you bought tokens during the pre-sale here can you transfer them to the LTO Network mainnet.</p>
        <p>
          To transfer your tokens you will need to send your LTO Tokens to our bridge. Our bridge will then transfer you
          mainnet tokens to this wallet. If you click 'Let's get started' we will give you an address to send your waves tokens to.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will also receive an option to send some waves, so that you have enough to transfer you LTO Tokens to the bridge.
          You will be asked to give you Waves address where we will send the tokens to.
        </p>
        <p><b>Attention: Don't tranfer WAVES or other tokens to the bridge, because they will not be refunded.</b></p>
